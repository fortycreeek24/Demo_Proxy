## FAQ
- In express server set up a default route that the proxy will call to and that route will send the bundle.js file back to the proxy
- If you cant find a bundle.js it is because you are using react-app (use boiler plate in group slack or ask for it to be sent again)
- In proxy html header use a scripit tag to the route you setup in your component server and make sure your react index will target the div in the body to be rendered
- If nothing shows up it is most likely you are not sending the bundle.js correctly 


- Will not accept pull request if component does not work on you're end
- Do not modify any components here, Tell the respecting person about ideas on there component or any conflicts that occur with that persons component
